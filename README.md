A Study of Family by Jonathan Haggard


### Development Workflow

1. Git
As this site is a hosted by github as a page, it is important to keep our work on the gh-pages branch. I need to think about it a bit more, but there bay be a workflow where we are pushing work to master, and then deploying to gh-pages, but for now, lets just push to gh-pages and know that they are live.


2. -Kit-
-We use .kit templating language to take care of simple includes and variables. This means that we should never be editing .html files because those edits will just be overwritten and lost when the .kit files are compiled to html.-

2.1. Jekyll
We dont use .kit anymore, we are running on jekyll.

3. Assets
Jon, you said you had some ideas about how you want to organize the site, let's circle back on that.


4. Be awesome
Do that.
