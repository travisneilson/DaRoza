  <hr class="ball-rule ball-left ball-right" />
    <p>A woman with whiles to make men end their lives, tenacity and willingness to join the circus leaving her 10 month old baby behind. Julia Coster was a heartbreaker and a gypsy of the west coast. Her first husband was her cousin. He killed himself after she wouldn’t let him see their child Lorraine on Christmas. She raised Lorraine until she was 10 months old, and left her to Lorraine’s grandmother Flora. </p>

    <h3>Julia Coster</h3>
        
    <p>Julia found the love of her life and was happily together for 12 years when Herman was suddenly killed one day when he was crossing the street drunk and was struck dead by a Greyhound bus. Julia sped up her chaos up to the point of forging money with a new husband.</p> 
    
    <p>Widely regarded to have told the most foul and hilarious jokes, Julia was loved by many of her family members with exception to her daughter Lorraine. The two resented each other and would go on without reconciliation. When she finally settled down on her sister Josephine’s ranch she would end stories with “I’ve been around kid, I know!”</p>
